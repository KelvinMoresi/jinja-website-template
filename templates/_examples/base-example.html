<h1>An Example Page</h1>
<p>
    This page is just an example of how to use
    Jinja,
    Bootstrap&nbsp;<i class="fa-brands fa-bootstrap"></i>,
    and Font Awesome&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-font-awesome"></i>
    to create a simple page!

    The page is created using a base template that should be used by all pages
    by default.
</p>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-6">
            This is a column in Bootstrap's grid system.
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            This is also a column. Both are in a single row.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
